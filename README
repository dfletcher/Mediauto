-----------------------

NOTE: This project is currently very early in development and not yet ready
      for deployment on live systems. It is going up on github now for
      early adopters and people interested in helping with development.

Mediauto runs automatic backups of DVDs (and eventually CDs, BDs and HD-DVDs)
and provides information about the progress of these backups over D-BUS.

Mediauto is NOT a tool for piracy. It is a system to help people make personal
backup copies of fragile plastic media. Mediauto does not bypass any security
systems, it only wraps existing command line programs in Linux, a handy
"script" that runs automatically when media is inserted.

Mediauto may be configured to perform a series of user defined actions when
discs are inserted.

Example DVD inserted:
  - backup the DVD using dvdbackup
  - eject the disc
  - make an .iso file with mkisofs
  - clean up temporary files
  - make one or more XVid .avi files for different sized screens using mencoder

Prerequisites:

    DVD copying:
        http://download.videolan.org/pub/videolan/libdvdcss/1.2.10/libdvdcss-1.2.10.tar.gz
        ftp://mirror.ovh.net/gentoo-distfiles/distfiles/libdvdread-0.9.7.tar.gz
        http://downloads.sourceforge.net/dvdbackup/dvdbackup-0.4.1.tar.gz
        
    Transcoding:
        http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html
        (be sure to build with LAME and XVid support)

    Currently not required (but may well be in future):
        http://www.srcf.ucam.org/~cjk32/dvdid/

Building:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make

[NOTE: make install is currently not supported!]

Running:

    sudo cp etc/dbus-1/system.d/mediauto.conf /etc/dbus-1/system.d/
    gedit etc/mediauto.conf
    python site-packages/mediauto.py --config=etc/mediauto.conf

The first line copies the D-Bus configuration rules into your system and is
required to enable signals. Currently there is an entry in there giving user
"fletch" ownership rights over the org.mediauto.Mediauto bus. If you want to
launch from the command line, you will need to change this to your login name.

Edit the configuration file and change the default dvd.destination and any
other desired tweaks. The etc/mediauto.conf file should have been generated
while running ./configure.

The third line starts the daemon. There will be a better way to do this in
future.

Signals:

Mediauto publishes progress of operations in progress over D-Bus with signals:

        Signal name: ProcessStarted
    D-Bus interface: org.mediauto.Mediauto.Manager
         Sender bus: org.mediauto.Mediauto
        Object path: /org/mediauto/Mediauto/Manager
          Arguments: (string)process_type, (string)process_id
        Description: Sent at the start of a process.

        Signal name: PercentComplete
    D-Bus interface: org.mediauto.Mediauto.Manager
         Sender bus: org.mediauto.Mediauto
        Object path: /org/mediauto/Mediauto/Manager
          Arguments: (string)process_type, (string)process_id, (double)percent
        Description: Sent frequently during operations to notify listening
                     programs of progress.

        Signal name: ProcessEnded
    D-Bus interface: org.mediauto.Mediauto.Manager
         Sender bus: org.mediauto.Mediauto
        Object path: /org/mediauto/Mediauto/Manager
          Arguments: (string)process_type, (string)process_id
        Description: Sent at the end of a process.

Future D-Bus API additions will allow programs to query other information about
processes and media (discs) using the process_id supplied by these signals.

TODO:
    - Module system. mediauto.py should not directly include any media types
      (currently it hard-codes DVD). Also, modules should be able to hook
      other modules processes, inserting code to run before and after.
    - init scripts for various systems
    - Logging
    - CD support
    - BD support
    - HD-DVD support
    - iPod/iPhone/iPad support
    - Gnome toolbar monitor
    - Command line monitor (in progress, currently broken)
    - XBMC plugin / support - ping XBMC to reload it's library when new files
      are available.
    - Title lookups on themoviedb.org and thetvdb.com
    - Local database of DVD Id, checksum, title and any other relevant details.
